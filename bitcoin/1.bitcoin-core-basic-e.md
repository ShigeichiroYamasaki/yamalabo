## Bitcoin Node   Peer

Launch the installed bitcoin core app and IBD will start.
The default is mainnet, so IBD takes a long time to complete.
Since signet will be used for learning and development, do not wait for IBD to complete, modify the bitcoin core configuration file, and exit. How to configure signet and how to start/stop bitcoin core are explained below.

### Start bitcoin-qt

If installed with snap

``` bash
bitcoin-core.qt &
```

For normal installation

``` bash
bitcoin-qt&
```

### bitcoin-cli commands

If installed with snap

``` bash
bitcoin-core.cli <command>
```

For normal installation

``` bash
bitcoin-cli <command>
```

Below, bitcoin-core.cli is described as a bitcoind client. Evaluate the command by replacing it with your own environment as appropriate.

### bitcoin core RPC API

The bitcoin core API specification can be found at the link below.

[bitcoin-core API](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/)

## Bitcoin network

### Example signet config file

Edit the configuration file (bitcoin.conf)

* Default location of bitcoin.conf during normal installation on ubuntu
  * ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
* default location of bitcoin.conf when installed with snap on ubuntu
  * ~/snap/bitcoin-core/common/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
* Default location of bitcoin.conf when package installed on MacOSX
  * ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
1. MacOSX : "Preferences" in the "File" menu..
2. ubuntu: "Options" in the "Settings" menu
3. Click the "Open configuration file" button
4. Create and save the configuration file as follows (please change rpcuser and rpcpassword from hoge)

``` bash
signet=1
txindex=1
daemon=1
server=1
rest=1
[signet]
rpcuser=hoge
rpcpassword=hoge
rpcport=38332
port=38333
fallback fee=0.0002
```
